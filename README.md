Files and Docs to debug conda, pip, and environments

- Put in your working environment files that work on your machine
- if there's a setup that did not work create a separate set of file and document how/why it didn't work and show the error message

Also:

- in your own folder list your current system specs
  - List the OS, OS version, system type (m1, m2, intel/arm windows, etc)
  - use this as a reference: <https://support.home.sophos.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005340066-Finding-Operating-System-Information-on-Windows-and-Mac>
